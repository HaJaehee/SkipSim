## Tutorial: Efficiency Experiment
For this quick-start tutorial, we will perform an efficiency experiment on Proof-of-Validation consensus protocol defined [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332104732_LightChain_A_DHT-based_Blockchain_for_Resource_Constrained_Environments). 
When a new transaction is generated, we aim to find a predefined number of honest nodes that can act as validators for the transaction.
Efficiency experiment measures the average number of honest nodes that are acquired throughout the simulation.
### Building

First, clone this repository on your local computer:

`$ git clone https://github.com/yhassanzadeh13/SkipSimWS` 

This project uses Gradle as its build system.

### Configuring

Open `SkipSimParameters.java` and set the following parameters:
```java
public static final boolean NumIdHashing = true;
private static int ValidatorThreshold = 12;
private static int SignatureThreshold = 1;
public static float MaliciousFraction = 0.16f;
...
//////////////////////////////////////Experiments/////////////////////////////////////////
...
public static boolean MaliciousSuccessExperiment = false;
public static boolean EfficiencyExperiment = true;
public static boolean AvailabilityExperiment = false;
public static boolean OnlineProbabilityExperiment = false;
public static boolean btsMaliciousSuccessExperiment = false;
public static boolean btsEfficiencyExperiment = false;
```
Then create a new class "Blockchain" under the SimulationSchema package:
```java
package SimulationSchema;

import DataTypes.Constants;
import Simulator.SkipSimParameters;

public class Blockchain extends SkipSimParameters {
    public Blockchain() {
        SimulationType = Constants.SimulationType.BLOCKCHAIN;
        ChurnType = Constants.Churn.Type.COOPERATIVE;
        SystemCapacity = 1024;
        LandmarksNum = 10;
        NameIDLength = 10;
        //LOG = true;
        TopologyNumbers = 1;
        LifeTime = 168;

        SessionLengthScaleParameter = Constants.Churn.Model.Debian.Fast.SessionLength.Scale;
        SessionLengthShapeParameter = Constants.Churn.Model.Debian.Fast.SessionLength.Shape;
        InterarrivalScaleParameter = Constants.Churn.Model.Debian.Fast.SessionInterarrival.Scale;
        InterarrivalShapeParameter = Constants.Churn.Model.Debian.Fast.SessionInterarrival.Shape;
    }
}
```
Now, we need to make sure that the SkipSim will use this schema while running the simulation. To do this, go to the SchemaManager
class and modify it as the following:
```java
package SimulationSchema;

public class SchemaManager {
    public SchemaManager() {
        new Blockchain();
    }
}
```
With these settings, we will measure the average number of honest nodes that are achievable in 12 (ValidatorThreshold) trials.

### Running
For this tutorial we will use an already generated simulation. Download it [here](#) and put it on the SkipSim directory. Rename it as `skipsim3db.db`.

Run SkipSim, and you will presented with the options of
(1) loading a simulation
(2) creating a new simulation. 

Click on `Open` from the top menu, and choose `100_1024_DEBIAN_1W` from the drop-down menu. 
This simulation uses FAST_DEBIAN as a churn model, and it has 1024 nodes. The simulation is done over one week (168 hours).

Click on `OK` and watch as the simulation runs. The experiment results will be outputted on the standard output.
